      <h1 class="mb-4">Who Is Jack Ciattarelli?</h1>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Jack has been running for Governor in New Jersey for almost a decade -
        will he ever take the hint? There have been a variety of allegations
        thrown at Jack this election cycle - some old and some new, some
        borrowed, and some blue. Let's review each one in detail.
      </p>

      <h2 class="py-4">Galen Publishing</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Jack always talks about his history starting
        <em>Main Street</em> business. Galen Publishing, in fact, was located on
        Main Street in Somerville, but that doesn't make them a Mom n' Pop small
        business. Instead, Galen was working with some of the biggest offenders
        in the Opioid crisis to develop and publish Opioid propaganda, such as
        this snippet -
        <a
          href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/09/ciattarelli-often-touts-his-main-street-business-on-the-campaign-but-it-was-no-mom-and-pop-operation.html"
          target="_blank"
          >"The risk of opioid misuse is low among patients with chronic pain
          who do not have preexisting substance use disorders."</a
        >
        Galen was paid over $12M in grants, but it is unclear exactly how much
        of that was for opioid propaganda. In our opinion, $1 is disqualifying.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Maybe you are willing to overlook immoral income sources because Jack is
        a great businessman? But would a great businessman sell his
        <em>Main Street</em>

        business to a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Lindberg" target="_blank">
          Billionaire like Greg Lindberg</a

        Commit Wire Fraud, and just even ran a

          >surveillance operation on women</a

        - does everyone in Jack's network do awful things? Would a great
        businessman need to

          >Sue the Buyer to get paid</a

          target="_blank"
          >"Unfit to be the nominee of our party, let alone Governor."</a
        >
      </p>

      <h2 class="py-4">Mikie's Personal Information</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Nicholas De Gregorio from Jack's opposition research team submitted a
        FOIA request about MIkie Sherrill to the the National Archives and
        Records Administration (NARA). In response, NARA
        <a
          href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-archives-mikie-sherrill-military-record-jack-ciattarelli/"
          target="_blank"
          >illegally released an unredacted copy of Sherrill's military record
          with sensitive personal information</a
        >
        including addresses and social security numbers. The bombshell in the
        records was that Mikie was not allowed to walk with her class in the
        Naval Academy, which suggested she violated the honor code by not
        ratting our her classmates in the Naval Academy cheating scandal in the
        90's. Mikie did not Cheat, and she did not Rat, but it sure looks like
        Jack did Cheat. Jack may swear that he has no clue what his own
        opposition research team does, but that sounds dishonest. Between Galen
        and his opposition research team - does Jack ever take responsibility
        for what happens on his watch? We speculate, without proof, that it's
        more likely that Jack and Trump, who tweeted about Mikie the same
        morning the records were announced, colluded to make this
        <em>"oopsie"</em> to influence the election. When Jack and Trump
        mishandle the records of their political opponents who served, they make
        it clear they can't be trusted in Trenton.

  <h2 class="py-4">A Horrific Show of Support</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Vincent Battiloro, a 17 year old from Cranford, NJ has been arrested for the
    vehicular homicide of 2 teenage girls, Maria Niotis and Isabella Salas, on
    September 30, 2025. Vincent was a Livestreamer, and although his YouTube was
    scrubbed, we have seen several unsettling videos depicting months of
    harassment. Between his Livestreams and
    <a href="https://x.com/vinniebat18/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> (still up
    as of 10/15), it was clear that he supported Andrew Tate, was angry at Maria
    for breaking up with him and for allegedly laughing at Charlie Kirk, and he
    eerily
    <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/9IHCIjwzsrc" target="_blank"
      >expressed support for Jack Ciattarelli in his Livestream after the
      horrific incident</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    There has been limited news coverage of this story, and most of the coverage
    has focused on the suspect being allowed to return home after the accident
    due to his family members in the police department or on Charlie Kirk, but
    Vincent expressing support for Jack Ciattarelli is NOT a coincidence. Jack
    is surrounding himself with cheaters, propagandists, and white nationalists
    like Benny Johnson, who recently deleted an AI video of himself in a Batman
    costume assaulting minorities, then , and his supporters are killing their
    neighbors of color. Trump and Jack are LYING and blaming the Left for
    political violence (NIJ Research on Domestic Terrorism, buried by the Trump
    administration), but the statistic show it Domestic Terrorism is primarily,
    but not only, from the Right. New Jersey demands better than Purposeful
    Disinformation followed by Silence from our elected leaders.

  <h2 class="py-4">Who is Jack Campaigning With?</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Look who Jack Ciattarelli is campaigning with -

    organizer, White Nationalist), and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Posobiec" target="_blank"
      >Jack Posobiec</a
    >
    (White Nationalist, Stop The Steal promoter, Conspiracy Theorist incl.
    Pizzagate). By surrounding himself with hateful people who consistently lie
    to the American people, Jack telegraphs that he will dispute the election
    results and attempt to rip New Jersey apart the way Trump ripped the country
    apart with his Big Lie in 2020. Trump, Ciattarelli, Kirk, Tate, Johnson,
    Presler, Posobiec. What they are teaching our sons makes our daughters less
    safe.

  <h2 class="py-4">Jack the Family Man</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Jack parades himself on the campaign trail like a Family Man, lecturing us
    on his good old-fashioned family values, but it looks like his never-ending
    quest for the Governorship isn't helping his personal life. Why was

    pretending that Jack has all the answers.
